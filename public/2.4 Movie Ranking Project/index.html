<h1>The Best Shows According to Me</h1>
<h2>My Must Watch List of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Rick and Morty</h3>
<p>Humor is super goofy and offers a lot of sci-fi adventures.</p>

<h3>Regular Show</h3>
<p>The most random episodes make for the funniest episodes. Anything <br />
can happen they can be playing video games one second then 1v1ing a <br />
god in order to save the park.</p>

<h3>Adventure Time</h3>
<p>Great show for action and the development of the plot and main <br />
character is amazing.</p>

<h3>Bob's Burgers</h3>
<p>Goofy show that sets each episode as a slice of life genre.</p>

<h3>Amazing World of Gumball</h3>
<p>Super goofy show with some dumb humor, but is great for laughs.</p>
